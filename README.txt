# This program is giving you the exact place at the real time on earth.

# Required modules are mentioned in requirements.txt

# Earth's Rotation is not stimulated and satellite size is exagerated for clarity


1. We have used newton's law of motion and the concepts of gravity to make sure that all the necessary parameteres should be taken care.
2. We are giving the exact location of the satellite on the Earth in terms of Latitude and Longitude
3. We had represented the whole satellite system graphically in 3-d view. Please have a look!
